# RimClan-Warrior-Cats
A mod for Rimworld that aims to let players play as Warrior Cats from the books by Erin Hunter. This is a project to help me grow my coding skills. Any help appreciated.

# PROJECT GOALS:
  ☐ Make Warrior Cat Pawn
      ☐ See if you can use the Cat Textures
      ☐ See if we can let them eat animals raw like animals do in Vanilla Rimworld.
  ☐ Make Factions
      ☐ 3 other Warrior Clans
          ☐ Get Pics
      ☐ Maybe add a Rogue Faction.
  ☐ Adjust Events
      ☐ Remove Anti-thematic Events
      ☐ Create events that fit the mod.
  ☐ Create Structures
      ☐ Add Thick Bramble Walls
      ☐ Add Fresh Kill Pile
  ☐ Herbs
      ☐ Add Herbs for medicine cats
  ☐ Create Clan Ideology
  ☐ Create Recipes for medicine
      ☐ Poltice
  ☐ Create Quests
      ☐ Maybe add a meeting quest that pops up once a year.
